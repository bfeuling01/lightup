# Lightup Metric Trigger

This CLI is used to trigger metrics

# How To

The CLI, when run, will get all triggerable metrics and tables, and then allow the user 
to select which metric or table of metrics the user wants to trigger.

To run the CLI, make sure that the lightup API credential file is in the same location
as the CLI being run. Make sure that you install the required python libraries found in
requirements.txt file

# TODO

Incorporate the trigger CLI into the main Lightup CLI
